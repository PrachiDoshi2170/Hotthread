Web Develpoment is a process that helps small buisness present their work to the world and sell to more wider audience. 
With this perspective in mind, Hotthreads a small clothing brand located in Ahmedabad gave us an opportunity to pick up their website project as our Semester-V Web Develpoment Project.

Thus, this repository contains a glimpse of the project that we tried our hands on. 
The HotThreads website is mainly built on languages/technologies
  1. HTML5
  2. CSS3
  3. JavaScript and Jquery
  4. PHP
  5. AJAX
  6. Database by phyMyAdmin
  
This project gave me and my team an opportunity to venture the above mentioned frameworks. The repositary refers to 4 modules that we were succsfull in creating it from scratch, 
that are :
  a. Homepage
  b. LoginPage/SignUp Page
  c. Shopping Cart Page
  d. Checkout Page
  
You can download and run this project after creating the given database in phpMyAdmin, and then running it on Xampp. The project works perfectly fine except for the fact that
you will not be able to watch the logo as the commpany holds the rights to the logo and since we were out of time in our Semester-V, we were not able to create a responsive website.

We hope that this project will contribute in helping other people to build the website from the scratch.ðŸ˜Š
